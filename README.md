# fractal-softmax
This repository will be updated with implementations of fractal softmax and related papers in the future. The fractal softmax technique originates from the 2nd-place solution in the MICCAI 2024 AortaSeg Challenge, as detailed in "Hierarchical Semantic Learning for Multi-Class Aorta Segmentation" at https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14187.
